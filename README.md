# MyGrades-2.0

Extension that works with mygann+ to show grades on mygann. There are two ways to show the grades using this extension:

1. On the progress page use the show hide buttons to show or hide the letter grade, points out of total points, and percentage

2. On the progress page, even when hidden, hover over the area where the grade would be to show the same information in a hover box.
